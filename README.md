# queueing_theory
This repository hosts all the R codes and data files required to replicate the visualisations of MANM304 course work. 

# Data Trail
All the csv and excel files used for the visualisations have been extracted from 'Simulation Results(1).xlxs' file. Clear audit trails were left in the file before copying them to individual data files for the ease of coding.
